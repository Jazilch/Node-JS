# Node-Endpoint 

This project is how to build a simple endpoint in Node.js. What we are looking to do here is we have data that is stored locally and we want to be able to GET all of this data from an endpoint which is structured as a URL. 

By creating this endpoint we make it easier to get all of this data and with a couple different methods we can easily make requests that allow us to just get a specific contact of object back from this JSON view. 

You will see a server.js file that has been created and this is where all of node.js will be for the bulk of this project.
